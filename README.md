# street_tree_census_eda
2015 NYC Street Tree Census exploratory analysis

### Usage
Unfortunately Github does not currently render R Markdown files, so to view the project open the PDF export instead. (I've been experiencing some pdflatex related issues in knitting directly to .pdf so the file is currently a suboptimally formatted PDF export of an HTML knit, but hopefully that can be fixed soon.)

If using the .rmd file, unzip the compressed files in the Data and Shapefiles folders before running.
